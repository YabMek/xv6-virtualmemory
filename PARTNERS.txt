Yeabsira Mekonnen(ytm9yz)
Nicholas Talton(nrt3xs)

Yeabsira and Nicholas worked together on each part of the lab. We worked through both the logic and implementation of both the growproc and trap functions.
After running it through the test suite we were getting some errors about allocating memory and seg faults. After going back and checking the logic we passed all cases.
They both tested the implementation with the ptetool and QEMU monitor.
